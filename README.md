# [Programming Foundations with Python, Udacity course (ud036)](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036)
Kunal Chawla, a fantastic teacher, teaches Python and basic object-oriented programming to total beginners by showing you to build 6 simple projects:

1. Project Take a Break: Schedules breaks throughout the day and opens a YouTube video periodically. http://youtu.be/C29aerpwkc8
2. Rename Files: Renames all filenames of a folder full of images, to spell a secret message.
3. Drawing Turtles: Uses Python's Turtle module to draw shapes in different patterns: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cM05mJK4JQ. If you type ```python -m turtledemo``` in the Terminal, you get a ton of beautiful demos, mostly mathematical, which I show in screenshots in /turtle folder. Try playing with the code yourself!
4. Project Profanity Editor: Detects curse words and saves clumsy email writers from profanity. http://youtu.be/Rvj2UI-wVXA
5. Send Text with Twilio: Uses Twilio to send your phone a text message.
6. Movie Webpage: A webpage that lists your favorite movies and shows their trailers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0FoelOIZM0&t=1m24s
